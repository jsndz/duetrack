Project Name: DueTrack – Simple Online Bill Reminder System

Overview:
DueTrack is a minimal, web-based bill reminder system designed to help users 
organize, track, and remember their recurring financial obligations. 
The purpose of the platform is to eliminate the stress of forgotten payments by 
providing a clean interface where users can manually add their bills and 
receive timely reminders.

DueTrack focuses on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use. It does not attempt 
to compete with large finance applications; instead, it provides a fast, 
lightweight experience for people who only want a straightforward way to manage 
their bills without unnecessary extras.

Purpose:
Many people miss payments for rent, electricity, subscriptions, and other 
monthly expenses simply because they forget. Existing apps often include 
budgeting tools, graphs, ads, or require full account creation, making them 
feel heavy and complicated. DueTrack solves this by providing a clean, 
distraction-free reminder service that works immediately.

Target Users:
- Individuals who prefer simple tools over complex finance apps.
- Students managing rent and recurring expenses.
- Families keeping track of multiple utility bills.
- Anyone who frequently forgets due dates.
- Users who don’t want to install mobile apps and prefer a web solution.

Core Features:
1. Add Bill:
   Users can add bills with details such as bill name, amount, due date, 
   and repeat cycle (monthly, yearly, or one-time). This ensures every user 
   can create a personalized bill list that fits their needs.

2. Dashboard:
   A clean and minimal dashboard shows upcoming, due, and overdue bills in a 
   structured format. Users can quickly see what needs attention.

3. Email Reminders:
   DueTrack sends automated reminders before the due date and on the due date 
   itself. This helps users consistently stay on top of payments.

4. Optional Sign-in:
   To minimize friction, DueTrack can be used without requiring signup. Bills 
   can be stored locally in the browser through localStorage. Users may choose 
   to create an account later for cloud backups or multi-device sync.

5. Simplicity and No Ads:
   The platform is intentionally kept minimal, with no ads, charts, financial 
   complexity, or unnecessary features. The primary focus is usability and 
   reliability.

Project Goals:
- Provide an easy-to-use, instant reminder system for all kinds of bills.
- Help users reduce late fees and missed payments.
- Build a lightweight, fast-loading tool that works on all devices.
- Offer a no-friction experience that users can begin using immediately.

Why This Project:
People frequently forget upcoming payments—not due to financial issues, but 
because they lack a reliable reminder system. Most existing apps are 
overcomplicated for users who only need a simple reminder. DueTrack fills this 
gap by doing one job exceptionally well: reminding users when their bills are 
due.

Future Enhancements (Not part of the MVP but possible additions):
- Google Calendar or iCal integration
- WhatsApp or Telegram reminder notifications
- Automatic detection of bills from uploaded PDFs or emails
- Monthly analytics and spending summaries
- Bill categorization (rent, utilities, subscriptions, etc.)
- Shared bill tracking for roommates or family members

Conclusion:
DueTrack is built on the philosophy that simplicity can be powerful. With a 
clean interface, customizable reminders, and a frictionless experience, 
DueTrack helps users stay organized and avoid late payments. Its minimal design 
makes it accessible to everyone and suitable for everyday life.
